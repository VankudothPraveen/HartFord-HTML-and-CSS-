##This project is a command-line based Purchase Order (PO) and Invoice Management System built using pure JavaScript.
##It simulates how a corporate training organization manages trainer payments by generating Purchase Orders and Invoices after training completion.

##The application takes dynamic user input from the command prompt, calculates payments based on different billing types, generates invoices, tracks due dates, and identifies overdue payments with simulated email alerts.
