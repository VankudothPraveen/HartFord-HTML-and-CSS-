The system also includes an insurance module, where each account holder can have insurance policies such as Health, Life, Home, and Wealth Protection. By entering an account number, the user can view both the transaction details and insurance information of that customer.

This project helps in understanding how real-world banking and insurance systems work using JavaScript classes and objects.
